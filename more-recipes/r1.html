        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>Good ole Southern fried food! The cornmeal really brings out the flavor of the crookneck squash. I serve this as a side dish with just about any meal during the season.</em></p>

            }        
        </style>

        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, or as needed</li>
            <li>3 large crookneck (yellow) squash</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>Â½ cup cornmeal</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add enough canola oil to cover the bottom of a large skillet. Heat over medium to medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Slice squash. Sprinkle slices with salt, then roll in cornmeal to coat.</li>
            <li>Add all squash slices to the hot oil and allow to fry for 5 minutes without turning. Turn and continue to fry, flipping every so often, until crispy and golden brown on both sides, 10 to 15 more minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
